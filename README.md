Bayesian Allocation for Differential Resampling (BayDAR)
======
# Motivation
In genomic studies, one is often faced with mutiple-hypotheses testing
scenarios (~1E+06). When analytical formulas are available the main problem is
determining an appropriate threshold for rejecting the null hypotheses and
controlling the family-wide error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR).
However, often in the case of some test statistics an analytical formula is
unavailable or the assumptions underpinning such a formula are unrealistic (e.g.
small sample sizes or non-Gaussian data). In these cases, a resampling-based
test is desirable. However, this approach can be computationally infeasible: To
reject H0 at a significance threshold of 1e-06, which is common in GWAS studies,
at 1 million SNPs would require 1 trillion resamples. 
# Algorithm
To avoid this pitall, [Wang *et al.*](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/198/)
proposed a Bayesian scheme  for the differential allocation of resamples. The
algorithm is described in detail in the paper but can succinctly described as
follows- 
> "...we use a Bayesian-inspired approach that assigns resamples to each unit
based on its individual risk, the chance that the current p-value estimate
leads to a misclassification of the unit. The goal is to lower the numbers of
classification errors, since we are giving a higher resolution to the null
distribution of genes that are more likely to be misclassified in a uniform
allocation setting. This higher resolution comes at the sacrifice of resamples
to non-borderline genes that should not need a very resolute null distribution
for correct inference."
